        <h2><u>PacMen Factory Exercise</u></h2>
        <p>Creates a PacMan every time the "AddPacMan" button is pressed.   Pressing "Start Game" causes all the 
           PacMen to start moving, each at a random velocity that was assigned to it when it was created.  Whenever
           any PacMan collides with a boundary of the screen, it bounces off the boundary and remains within the screen.</p>
