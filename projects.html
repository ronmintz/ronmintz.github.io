            <h2>Eye Movement Exercise</h2>

            <h2>PacMen Factory Exercise</h2>
            <p>Creates a PacMan every time the "AddPacMan" button is pressed.   Pressing "Start Game" causes all the 
               PacMen to start moving, each at a random velocity that was assigned to it when it was created.  Whenever
               any PacMan collides with a boundary of the screen, it bounces off the boundary and remains within the screen.

            <h2>Real Time Bus Tracker</h2>
            <p>Displays the actual real-time position of each bus on the Boston MBTA #1 bus route on a map of Cambridge
               and part of Boston.  These positions are obtained by accessing an MBTA website in real-time.  The color
               of each marker on the map indicates the direction of the bus it represents.  Blue markers indicate buses
               going toward Harvard Square.  Red markers indicate buses going away from Harvard Square toward Boston.
