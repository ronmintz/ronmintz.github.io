  <p>I am an experienced programmer but am taking this bootcamp
     to upgrade my skills to current technology.  I have a Ph.D.
    in Applied Math and Computer Science and have programmed in
    C, C++, Java, Python, MATLAB, SQL, Fortran, and Assembly Language.
    I'm taking this bootcamp to get into the newer technologies.
